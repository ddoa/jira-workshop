# Jira Workshop: Getting started
Before you can start with the workshop make sure you have Jira installed. This repo contains a script based on Docker, try this [first](prepare-environment/README.md). We have a manual script to back you up, but the Docker-script has less [manual](prepare-environment/MANUAL.md) steps to perform.

The folder [workshop-steps](workshop-steps) contains the actual workshop. Currently the workshop relies on the availability of an Jira expert in the workshop-room but we aim to do this workshop without any extra human assistance.
